#Write a function called mySqrt that will approximate the square root of a number, call it n,
#by using Newtow's algorithm. Newton's approach is an iterative guessing algorithm where
#the initial guess is n/2 and each subsequent guess is computed using the formula: newguess = (1/2) * (oldguess + (n/oldguess)).

#Newton's algorithm
#once the guesses start repeating you have gotten the correct result

n=input("Number:")
n=int(n)

oldguess=n/2
print("Guess 1", oldguess)

for i in range(100):
    newguess=(1/2)*(oldguess+(n/oldguess)) #does the Newton calculation

    if (oldguess==newguess):                                    #Checks if we have arrived at the answer
        exit=input("Press enter to close")
        quit()
    oldguess=newguess
    print("Guess", i+1, ":", newguess)
